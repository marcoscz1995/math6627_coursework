\begin{frame}{Outcome: Heart Disease}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The response variable is binary; whether a survey participant reported having some form of cardiovascular disease or not. 
    \item Heart disease includes having had a heart attack, angina, stroke or congestive heart failure.
    \item Responses are given by the individual, not their health care providers. They are self reported, but the questionnaire in the CCHS asked if their heart disease was diagnosed by a doctor in the last 6 months. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exposure/Risk Factor: OA}
\begin{itemize}
    \item OA is self reported in the CCHS survey.
    \item CCHS asked if they, in the last 6 months or more if they had OA or rheumatism, followed by “What type of arthritis?” and the four response
options were Rheumatoid arthritis, OA, other, and do
not know”.
    \item Since the second question is restricted to
only arthritis patients, over-reporting of OA is minimised. \cite{rahman2013relationship}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Covariates \& Confounders: Control Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The health literature suggest that  certain socio-demographic and health behaviour variables are risk factors to heart disease and potential confounders in the OA-heart disease relationship.
    \item \textbf{Socio-demographic covariates:} age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, geography, education and household income.
    \item \textbf{Health behaviour covariates: }physical activity, hypertension, access to a doctor, smoking habits, diabetes and drinking habits
