\begin{frame}{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Osteoarthritis (hereinafter OA) is a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and the underlying bone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness.\cite{Rahman_2014} 
        \item OA is a leading cause of disability among the elderly and therefore a major burden on both patients and the Canadian health care system. \cite{doi:10.1002/art.33467} 
        \item There is evidence to suggest that OA is associated with cardiovascular disease (hereinafter heart disease).\cite{singh2002prevalence}. 
        \item As heart disease is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Canada coupled with an aging population, this potential association is of much interest to epidemiologists and the health care community.
