\section{Methods}
\subsection{Data Sources}
We used data on risk factors from the cross-sectional
Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), cycles 1.1 (in
2001), 2.1 (in 2003) and 3.1 (in 2005). This survey gathers health-related data for the Canadian population 12 years of age and over living in the 10 provinces and 3 territories, covering about 97\% of the target population. Various measures were taken to protect the confidentiality of the participants of the survey and observations were not tracked over time.
\subsection{Study Sample}
The original CCHS dataset contained 397,173 observations. However, we removed observations whose age was not between 20 and 64 years old, removed those who had arthritis other than OA, and removed all observations not complete (observations with entries "NOT STATED", "DON'T KNOW", "REFUSAL" and in some cases "NOT APPLICABLE"). However, we kept "incomplete observations from the immigration column as we believe this question could have the under/misreporting due to fear of legal ramifications if the observant is not a Canadian citizen. This resulted with a data set with 200,478 observations.

We analyzed data for people 20 to 64 years of age who participated in the CCHSs in 2000-2001 (n=67,100), 2003 (n=65,560) and 2005 (n=67,818).
