\section{Results without Mixed Models}
\subsection{Poisson \& Linear Regression}
We first look at the result from the Poisson (\ref{poisson_simple_eqn}) and Linear (\ref{simple_linear_eqn}) regressions without mixed models. Table \ref{simple_results} summarizes the results. Lasso regression was used to select the most significant variables, however some variables were forced to be kept for the sake of comparing the two models.

What is interesting is that the Poisson model kept everything as significant whereas the Linear model removed the tittle labels Life and New and the theme labels
